	<h1>Success Story</h1>
	
	<h2>Wing Wong, SJSU MSCS 2006</h2>
	
	What I enjoyed most was working on security-related problems with my advisor, who had worked for the 
	National Security Agency as a cryptologic mathematician for some years before he joined SJSU. 
	My master's project involved using hidden Markov models to characterize and classify metamorphic computer 
	viruses and malware. Our results were published in the Journal in Computer Virology, and we gave talks 
	at DEFCON, the "largest underground hacking event in the world", at Stanford, and at Symantec Research 
	Labs. I now work at Symantec on a project to deliver website reputations and to provide users with a 
	safer online experience. The networking and security knowledge that I gained at SJSU has proven to be 
	essential in my day-to-day work.
