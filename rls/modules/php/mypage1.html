	<h1>Success Story</h2>
	
	<h2>Maggie Nguyen, SJSU MSCS 2004</h2>
	
	I enjoyed the writing project of my master degree, and I learned about the process of having papers 
	published and presenting them to conferences. (Maggie Nguyen, Layla Pezeshkmehr, and Melody Moh, 
	"Proxy-Assisted Multicasting of Video Streams over Mobile, Wireless Networks," in Proceedings of the 
	International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) Multimedia Processing and Applications Conference 
	on Multimedia on Mobile Devices, pp. 287-292, San Jose, 16-20 January 2005.) 

	My advice to other students is to be actively involved in classes as much as possible, and to pay 
	attention on those foundation classes, e.g. operating system, computer architecture, compiler, 
	and networking. These classes really help you a lot in the computer engineering industry.
