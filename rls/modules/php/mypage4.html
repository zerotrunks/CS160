	<h1>Success Story</h2>
	
	<h2>Martina Simova, SJSU MSCS 2005</h2>
	
	My master's project focused on foiling automated detection of ciphertext. To avoid unwarranted 
	attention of encrypted data, I developed a method of converting ciphertext into data that can 
	pass certain automated tests for English text. I wrote a paper entitled “Stealthy Ciphertext” 
    (with Dr. M. Stamp and Dr. C. Pollett) that I presented at the 2005 International Conference 
	on Internet Computing (ICOMP'05). 
	
	I am currently employed as a software engineer at IBM.
