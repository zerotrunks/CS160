	<h1>Success Story</h1>
	
	<h2>Patrick Ng, SJSU MSCS 2005</h2>
	
	While studying at SJSU for my MSCS degree, I was a full-time software engineer at Cisco Systems. 
	Although it is a challenge to balance both work and studies, it was an enjoyable experience. 
	In order to cope with my busy work schedule, I mostly took evening classes. I did research work 
	with Dr. Tseng on improving user satisfaction and accuracy in RSS information retrieval. 
	Our research was published in the “Information Management & Computer Security” journal.
