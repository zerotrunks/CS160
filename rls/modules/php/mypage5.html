	<h1>Success Story</h1>
	
	<h1>Khoi Nguyen, SJSU MSCS 2007</h1>
	
	<p>Are you curious about the public key cryptography that you often see in email messages, 
	protocol transactions, or computing articles? Do you know how easy (or difficult) it is to 
	do a cryptanalytic attack or to crack the security of software? Thanks to Dr. Stamp, these 
	topics no longer seem like black magic to me. Under his guidance, I developed and implemented 
	a practical security protocol for peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. This work involved lots of 
	fancy security topics. I have learned many interesting topics from other professors in the 
	CS department as well, such as Bioinformatics from Dr. Khuri. The MSCS program is not easy 
	and the thesis is challenging, but it is well worth it. It has certainly opened up my mind and 
	broadened my knowledge. I'm currently working for a startup company named Tyzx Inc., 
	specializing in the fascinating new frontier of computer vision.</p>
